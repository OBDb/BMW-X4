    description: "The original BMW X4 pioneered the compact Sports Activity Coupe (SAC) segment for BMW, adapting the coupe-SUV concept of the larger X6 to a smaller platform. Based on the F25 X3, it featured a distinctive sloping roofline and more aggressive styling while sharing most mechanical components with its more practical sibling. Engine options included four and six-cylinder petrol and diesel units, all paired with all-wheel drive (xDrive) and an automatic transmission. The M40i performance variant offered a 355 HP turbocharged six-cylinder engine. While sacrificing some practicality compared to the X3, particularly in rear headroom and cargo space, the X4 appealed to buyers seeking more distinctive styling in a compact premium crossover."

    description: "The current X4 is based on the G01 X3 platform but features more differentiated styling than its predecessor, with a longer wheelbase, wider track, and lower height creating a more athletic profile. The interior offers similar technology and features to the X3 but with a more driver-focused layout. Engine options range from efficient four-cylinders to the high-performance X4 M with up to 503 HP from its twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine. All models feature xDrive all-wheel drive and an automatic transmission as standard. A facelift in 2021 updated the exterior styling and interior technology, including a larger infotainment display and enhanced digital features. The second-generation X4 continues to cater to buyers seeking a more emotionally styled alternative to traditional SUVs, offering a compromise between utility and sporty design."
